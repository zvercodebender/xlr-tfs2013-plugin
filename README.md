# xlr-tfs2013-plugin v1.0.0

This plugin offers a rudimentary interface from XL Release to Team Foundation Server 2013.  It provides a CreateWorkItem.py script that executes a remote Windows batch script with Collection, Project, Type and Title parameters.

The functionality will be enriched with additional Work Item fields as specific needs materialize.

Notes:  The TFS machine must have Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2013 Update 2 Power Tools installed. Also, the CreateWorkItem.bat script must be placed in a location on the TFS machine.
